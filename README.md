# Map Mystery

A local-first geography game using country outlines and neighboring-country data.

## Modes

- `Region Chain`: Build a valid 4-country border chain between two countries.
- `Reverse Border`: Guess a country from a set of neighboring-country clues.
- `Battle Mode`: Pick which of two country outlines has more land neighbors.
- `Daily Puzzle`: A deterministic 5-question mixed set that changes daily.

## Settings

- From the mode selection screen, open `Settings` and choose a continent filter.
- The selected continent limits question generation and accepted answers across all modes.

## Run

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Competitive Mixed Mode (Supabase Leaderboard)

You can keep hosting the frontend on GitHub Pages and use Supabase for leaderboard storage.

Mixed mode (`Daily Puzzle`) uses a deterministic 5-question set each day.
Scoring is 1 point per correct answer, so total score is always out of 5 in this mode.

### 1. Create The Table In Supabase

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
create table if not exists public.leaderboard_scores (
	id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
	mode_id text not null,
	day_key date not null,
	display_name text not null,
	score integer not null,
	max_score integer not null,
	continent text not null default 'All',
	played_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index if not exists leaderboard_scores_mode_day_idx
	on public.leaderboard_scores (mode_id, day_key, score desc, played_at asc);
```

### 2. Turn On Row Level Security

In Supabase Table Editor, enable RLS for `leaderboard_scores`.

Then run these policies:

```sql
create policy "Public can read leaderboard rows"
on public.leaderboard_scores
for select
to anon
using (true);

create policy "Public can insert bounded mixed scores"
on public.leaderboard_scores
for insert
to anon
with check (
	mode_id = 'daily-puzzle'
	and score >= 0 and score <= 5
	and max_score = 5
	and char_length(display_name) between 3 and 16
);
```

### 3. Add Supabase Project Keys

In Supabase dashboard: `Project Settings -> API`

Copy:
- Project URL
- `anon` public key

Paste into `js/supabaseConfig.js`:

```js
export const SUPABASE_URL = "https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co";
export const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "YOUR_ANON_KEY";
```

### 4. Deploy On GitHub Pages

No server is required for hosting the game UI.
The static site stays on GitHub Pages, and browser requests go directly to Supabase.

### Security Note

This is good for casual competition. Since gameplay runs in the browser, determined users can still fake requests.
For stricter anti-cheat, add a Supabase Edge Function that validates signed game events before insert.

## Project Structure

- `js/app.js`: Main game shell, mode picker, and shared round flow.
- `js/gameData.js`: Data loading, normalization, and SVG outline rendering.
- `js/modes/regionChainMode.js`: Region Chain mode logic.
- `js/modes/reverseBorderMode.js`: Reverse Border mode logic.
- `js/modes/battleMode.js`: Battle Mode logic.
- `js/modes/dailyPuzzleMode.js`: Daily Puzzle mode logic.

## Local Data Assets

- `data/all_primary_countries.min.geojson` (country outlines)
- `data/GEODATASOURCE-COUNTRY-BORDERS.CSV` (border relationships)
- `data/countries.csv` (country attributes)
- `data/svgs/` and `data/svgs.zip` (WRI SVG map files)
- `vendor/d3.v7.min.js` (vendored D3)

## Attribution

- Outline data from `wri/wri-bounds`.
- Border relationship data from `https://www.geodatasource.com`.
